__Friend__

* This does not break the rule of encapsulation. This is because in the examples as we see, class is saying the function is a friend. So it is not breaking the rule.

* In the hierarchy, if a concrete class declare a fiend, the friend can only access this class, not its base class.

* at places, friend keyword is helping in testing the code.
